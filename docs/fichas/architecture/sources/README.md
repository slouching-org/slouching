This PDF is the source architecture. Its Rust/Iced client and Elixir backend
division is retained by [ADR 0005](../adr-0005-elixir-server-core.md). A
member-operated deployment can meet the owner's no-third-party requirement;
the detailed offline and direct-route behavior still needs review. Library
names in the PDF are candidates and need feasibility and maintenance review.
See the [current service boundary](../elixir-backend.md) and
[technology plan](../tech-stack.md).
